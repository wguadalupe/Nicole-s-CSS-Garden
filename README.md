Adding Your Own Style
Activity: My CSS Garden
Zen Garden is a well-known project where people added their own CSS designs to the same HTML. This demonstrates both the power of CSS and design.

We'll be creating our own mini version on replit.com. Go ahead and fork this replit to start making it your own.

My CSS Garden
Things to style:
Change the background-color of the body using a hex value.
Change the color and/or font-family of the body (use any type of color unit).
Select the nav and change the background-color to a different color using an rgb() color unit.
Select the aside and change the background-color to a different color using a hex color unit.
Using compound selectors, i.e., element1, element2 to select both the nav and aside, make each the same text color.
Target the anchor tags and remove the text-decoration.
Target the anchor and change the color.
